# Experiment 2 - Recentering

---

## Before

### Hypothesis
Recentering is better, even if strictly speaking the inequalities are not always true (just most of the time). We do not expect a significant difference between exact and nonexact inequalities.

### Setup

 - The dimensions:
D = {50, 52, ..., 140}

 - The number of signatures used:
N = {500, 600, ..., 7000, 8000, 9000, 10000}

 - The data source:
data = {sim, sw, card, tpm}

 - The recentering used:
rec = {yes, no}

 - each run 5 times, random sampling \( n \in N \) signatures, constructing lattice from \(d \in D\) shortest signatures, then doing geometric bounds from 2 bits on. Doing SVP with progressive BKZ (betas: 15, 20, 30, 40, 45, 48, 51, 53, 55).

 - In this experiment, we use \( l_i+1 \) instead of \( l_i \) in the matrix if we are in the **exact** or **inexact** recentering cases. In the **none** case, we do only \( l_i \), in the **bad** case we do \( l_i+1 \) but no recentering. Furthermore, the values \( 2^{l_i+1}u_i \) are replaced with \( 2^{l_i+1}u_i + 2^{256}Â \) if the **exact** recentering is used and with \( 2^{l_i+1}u_i + n \) if the **inexact** recentering is used.


2 * 4 * 68 * 45 = 24 480 tasks

each task does 5 runs of attack: 122 400 runs of attack.

Schedule tasks:

```
for rec in {exact, inexact, none, bad}
	for data in {real, sim}
	    for d in D
	        for n in N
	            schedule one geom task with (rec, data, n, d)
```

That makes 24 480 tasks.

### Outputs
Each task outputs {real,sim}\_{exact, inexact, none, bad}\_{n}\_{d}.csv with 5 lines for the 5 runs:

seed, success, duration, last_reduction_step, info, #liars, real_info, bad_info, good_info, result_row, result_norm

### Visualizations
For both real and sim data:
	For both exact and inexact:

 - 3D plot, x:N, y:D, z: number of successes.
 - 3D plot, x:N, y:D, z: last reduction step.
 - 3D plot, x:N, y:D, z: avg. duration of successful run.
 - 3D plot, x:N, y:D, z: avg. result row.
 - 3D plot, x:N, y:D, z: avg. result norm.
 - 2D lineplot, x:N, y:sum over d in D (number of successed).


### Why?

 - Compares both centering possibilities to the baseline.
