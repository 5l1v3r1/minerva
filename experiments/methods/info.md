# Experiment 2 - Methods for HNP solving

---

### Hypothesis
SVP is better than the others.

### Setup

 - Compare CVP(Babai, BKZ), CVP(Rounding, BKZ), SVP(BKZ), SVP(Sieving) on
 some interesting part of the parameter space, where the methods start to work.

### Outputs

 - As in the first experiment, the CVP options do not output `result_row` as that
 does not make sense.

### Visualizations

 - The same as in the first experiment.

### Why?

 - To know which method to use further.

### Conclusions

 - SVP is the best.
 - Babai NP works.
 - Babai rounding does not work.
 - g6k for sieving is hard to get to work(Python and code-wise, not result wise).
 So it remains untested.
