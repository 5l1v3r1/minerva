# Experiment 2

## Methods for HNP solving

### Hypothesis
Some of those are better than others.

### Setup

 - Compare CVP(Babai, BKZ), CVP(Rounding, BKZ), SVP(BKZ), SVP(Sieving BKZ) on
 some interesting part of the parameter space, where the methods start to work.

### Outputs

 - Similar to the first experiment, or even exact.

### Visualizations

 - The same as in the first experiment.

### Why?

 - To know which method to use further.
